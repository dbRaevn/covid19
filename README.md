# COVID-19 data, outbreak maps and charts

I try to make sense of the large amounts of information about the covid-19 pandemic in Australia by visually presenting it in a way that tells the story of the data.

This repository contains most of the maps, charts and diagrams that were created to track the spread of covid-19 across Australia.

These and the rest of my work can also be found on Twitter - [@dbRaevn](https://twitter.com/dbRaevn)
