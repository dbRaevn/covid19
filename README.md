# COVID-19 outbreak maps and charts

I try to make sense of the large amounts of information about the covid-19 pandemic in Australia by visually presenting it in a way that tells the story of the data.

This repository contains most of the maps, charts and diagrams that were created to track the spread of covid-19 across Australia.

These and the rest of my work can also be found on Twitter - [@dbRaevn](https://twitter.com/dbRaevn)

## Charts

Primarily charts of the vaccination rollout, but also includes some charts relating to Victorian and NSW outbreaks.

## Data

Contains pcr_rapid_cases.csv, listing daily reported PCR and Rapid cases for each state since 1st January 2022.

Data sources:

 * NSW: NSW Health twitter account (https://twitter.com/NSWHealth)
 * VIC: VicGovDH twitter account (https://twitter.com/VicGovDH)
 * QLD: Queensland Health twitter account (https://twitter.com/qldhealth)
 * WA: Mark McGowan twitter account (https://twitter.com/MarkMcGowanMP). WA report PCR cases only.
 * SA: SA Health twitter account(https://twitter.com/SAHealth), rapid tests via press conferences/news reports.
 * TAS: Department of Health, Tasmania facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/HealthTas)
 * ACT: ACT Health twitter account (https://twitter.com/ACTHealth)
 * NT: Northern Territory Government media releases (https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/updates)

Notes:

 * No backdating, revision or alteration of prior reported cases is performed. All case numbers are "as reported".
 * In SA, when a breakdown was not given between PCR and Rapid cases, all cases are count as PCR cases.
 * On some days, VIC reported different breakdowns/case numbers on their twitter account vs the daily dashboard/media release. For consistency, the twitter account value is used.
 * Some breakdowns between PCR and Rapid cases for some states were initially from press conferences/news reports, before the above data sources began reliably listing them.

This will be updated periodically, but with no guaranteed schedule.
